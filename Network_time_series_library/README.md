# NetsLib: A Time-series Prediction libraries for Network traffic and flow bursts prediction using Advance Deep Learning and Statistical approaches.

This folder hosts all the final code for network time-series library for all network operation data, which include data driven learning to predict Wide Area Network (WAN) traffic. We developed a time-series prediction library for Network traffic to predict flow bursts and prevent congestion. We implement a framework to characterize WAN and Internet traffic traces, exploring both statistical and deep learning approaches to produce multi-step predictions with minimal errors, because estimating future traffic can help improve link usage and optimize bandwidth utilization. 


## Instructions 
NetsLib is developed to hosts all the codes for network time-series library for all network operation data. It gives you real-time predictions and shows performance with ARIMA, SARIMA and all deep learning models. To run NetsLib please resolve the following dependencies:


* Tensorflow
* Keras 
* GPy
* apscheduler
* scikit-learn
* PyTorch



## Run
To run NetsLib in online mode use the following command to install all the required dependencies:
```python
command: python Setup.py 
```
