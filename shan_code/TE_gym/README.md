## deeproute-gym 
OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. deeproute-gym builds on top of OpenAI Gym's interfaces to create a environment that models packet routing in networks. deeproute-gym can be used to quickly start experimenting with reinforcement learning in packet routing problems. Later, you can use the pre-defined environments to create more specific environments for your particular use case.

## Installation

~~~bash
pip install gym
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
~~~

## Topology change

Change the topology by replacing the json file.

## Examples
Use shorted path algorithm to solve the packet routing problem. 
 
~~~bash
python main.py
~~~
