Code Review (Kunal):

Multi-step prediction 2,


Multi-step predcition 15 minutes in future

removing anomaly <15 around may 15th



add features for hours/minutes/ didnt help

not sliding window, use cut windows, skipped values to prevent overfitting
leads to less trainign window
model trains within 30 minutes

seq-to seq learning, aggregation of max and min, applying to network data, finding anomalies without thresholds, more dynamic,

running it on GPU? GCP
clone into GCP, 

false positives/negatives, mean square 
MSE error
