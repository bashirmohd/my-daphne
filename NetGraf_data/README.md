# NetGraf on Chameleon distributed Node set-up and End-to-End Network Performance Monotoring Experiment
In this experiment we will work through a Chameleon distributed Node set-up from scratch and then perform and End-to-End Network Performance Monotoring using selected network monitoring tools. We will start by setting up several nodes in Chicago site and Texas site, then install network monitoring tools to monitor perfomance of the overall network at every node.
