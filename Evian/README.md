# Evian : Enabling Various Intents for Autonomic Networks#

The Advanced Light Source is a Department of Energy-funded synchrotron facility that provides access to the brightest beams of soft X-rays. For an experiment,  a physicist will use those X-rays and will send it to a diamond. Then it will create raster images from this experiment. To keep these images for a future utilization, the physicist needs to store them in a database. In order to do that, the physicist calls a network engineer to set up the network for the transfer. We simply this process. We compared intent-based networking projects (INDIRA, OpenDayLight NIC, ONOS).  We found that no existing project was using Natural language processing to get a high-level language intent from the user.  The final goal is to design an autonomic system that will understand the userâ€™s intent, get all the requirements and will be aware about the current and future states of the network to do an intelligent installation of the user's intent.

# Installation #

## Packages to install ##
* spaCy
* rasa_nlu
* rasa_core version 10.0
* flask
* flask-restful
* tensorflow
* graphviz 

## installation ##
* Install the packages
* Install the english language package for spaCy : `python -m spacy download en`
* Test if the natural language understanding module works : 
	* Go in the folder *client* and train the nlu model : `make train_nlu`
	* In the same folder test the nlu model : `make test_nlu`
* Train and test the bot locally
	* Go in the folder *client* and train the core model `make train_core`
	* Test how the model works locally `make run`
	* Test how the model works online go in the folder `make online`
* Connection with Slack
	* Give the address of the bot to the slack api
	* Change credentials in the file `src/core/run_app.py`
* Run the bot on Slack
	* Go in the client folder and do `make run_app`

# Future work #
* Connection with Slack/Control of the intent by the Network Engineer thank to Slack
* Linking Evian with Sense
* Secure Connection to Sense (AuthN and AuthZ)
* **Think about all the security issues to reassure network engineers and the security team**. 
	Critical for the deployment of Evian
* Group/User Account -- Ressources Management
* Intent State Machine to handle outage events
* Listening from the network - Many questions about this (How to listen, what to listen, and what to do with the extracted information ?)
* Policy and Conflict Checking
* Develop more complex intents
* Design RDF3
* Evian 2
	* Deep Learning Network Predictions
	* For some tools, deep learning optimizations
	* Develop Evian for many others rendering tools
